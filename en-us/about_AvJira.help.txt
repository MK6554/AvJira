SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Module that makes it easier to fetch data from Jira.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The module automates parsing work logs and issues. It also allows adding new work logs.
    
    By default the module will require providing password and username for each session (until PowerShell is closed) on first command.
    
    It is possible to store credentials in an ENCRYPTED file - use command Set-AvJiraCredentials.
    After that data from this file will be used for logging in.
    If you change your password run the command again.

    It is recommended to put the results into a variables, like this:
    $logs = Get-AvJiraWorkLog
    This way the logs will be stored there, and you will be able to access them without connecting to the Jira server.

    Its alias is LogSum. To use it properly you should know how pipeline works in PowerShell.

    Get-AvJiraWorkLog | logsum

    Worklogs and issues are standard objects. You can filter the manually using Where-Object (?).
